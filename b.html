      My VGS had very old buildings, except for the STEM building which was only
      a couple of years old and equipped with some of the newest technology. I
      liked the school, despite it being known for being nerdy and very
      difficult.

      I went to Akademiet high school. The school is small and beautiful. I do
      miss my friends.

      I went on two different highschools, but you will only learn about
      Heltberg, which is actually, like, a minute away from OsloMet. It is just
      one floor. Literally. If the elevator was full, you had to either wait in
      line or go up five floors to get to the school. And yes, it was a private
      school. I had imagined it more beautiful. It wasn't.

      During my high school years, I attended both Valle Hovin Vgs and F21 Vgs.
      These schools were in close proximity, just a 5-minute walk apart. Valle
      Hovin is located within a football stadium and got the most impressive gym
      facility I've ever seen in an educational institution. On the other hand,
      F21 Vgs is a combined middle school and high school, which occasionally
      presented challenges due to the crowded cafeteria.

      I attended high school in Istanbul, Turkey. I made some great friends at
      school, and my teachers were excellent. They explained the lessons well,
      and we had a great relationship. Additionally, studying in Istanbul
      allowed me to explore this amazing city and spend quality time.
