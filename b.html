        I went on two different highschools, but you will only learn
        about Heltberg, which is actually, like, a minute away from OsloMet.
        It is just one floor. Literally. If the elevator was full, you had to
        either wait in line or go up five floors to get to the school. 
        And yes, it was a private school. I had imagined it more beautiful.
        It wasn't.
