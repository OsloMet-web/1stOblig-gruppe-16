    <p>
    During my high school years, I attended both Valle Hovin Vgs and F21 Vgs. These schools were in close proximity, just a 5-minute walk apart. Valle Hovin is located within a football stadium and got the most impressive gym facility I've ever seen in an educational institution. 
    On the other hand, F21 Vgs is a combined middle school and high school, which occasionally presented challenges due to the crowded cafeteria.
