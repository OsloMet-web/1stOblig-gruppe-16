    <h1>Assignment A</h1>
    <h2>Step 4: Create a simple HTML webpage (A)</h2>

    <p>
      Paste in at least part of the text from an "Innovation camp" assignment or
      an DATA1100 hand-in. Ensure that there are at least two headings.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should — but do not have to — collaborate on this page through
      Pull-request and Push-requests. You may collaborate through "mob
      programming" instead, where one person ("driver") writes while the rest
      ("mob") view the code on a shared screen and assists.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5: Create a second page (B)</h2>

    <p>
      In this page, every student in the group enters their own student number
      as a heading, and a few lines about their old school in a paragraph. ("My
      VGS had the best canteen lay-out in the region. A space over two floors
      where people could 'see and be seen', or hide in a nook.") You must do
      this through Pull-request and Push-requests!OR through updates (commits)
      directly in GitHub online In the log ("Commits") on GitHub, we expect to
      see every student in the group as a collaborator.In each page, include a
      link from Page A to Page B, and vice versa.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 6: Submit GitHub-link as your assignment hand-in</h2>
